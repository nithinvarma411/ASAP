# Project Title: Must-Watch Telugu Web Series for Every YouTube Addict

## Project Overview:
This project is a platform where users can log in and create a personalized list of must-watch Telugu web series on YouTube. The list will vary for each user, and they can add, update, or delete items.

## Key Features:
- User login and authentication  
- Add, update, and delete web series from the list  
- Personalized lists for each user  

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React with Vite  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Other Tools**: Mongoose, Postman for API testing  

## Why This Project:
I chose this project because it's fun, relatable, and allows me to practice all the concepts from the course. Currently, I only want to allow users to add their favorite web series, but I can also expand it further so they can see the YouTube web series link directly on the website.
